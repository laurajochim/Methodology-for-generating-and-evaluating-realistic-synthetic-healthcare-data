# Methodology for generating and evaluating realistic synthetic healthcare data

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for my Master's Thesis on generating and evaluating realistic synthetic healthcare datasets. It demonstrates a reproducible pipeline for:

Data Cleaning — Preparing clinical (EHR) and proteomic (TCGA) datasets.

Synthetic Data Generation — Creating synthetic patient records using multiple methods (synthpop, vine copula, ctGAN).

Evaluation — Comparing univariate distributions and other metrics between real and synthetic data.
